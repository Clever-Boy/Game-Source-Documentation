Game Source Documentation
=========================

The goal of this project is to produce complete language-independent documentations of video game source codes. A game's documentation can be considered mature once the information contained is sufficient enough for someone to produce an accurate port from that information alone without need for the original source code.

The documentation has to cover interpreting assets and implementation of game mechanics. It is not necessary, although appreciated, to document the exact implementation of a feature, as long as the documentation is sufficient enough to produce similar *looking* results. Hard-or software related implementation details only need to be documented if they are relevant, such as the endianess of numbers in asset files.
